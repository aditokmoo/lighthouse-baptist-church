						Can someone know anything for sure? Absolutely.....How? <br />
                        The Word of God states that we can know
						for sure that we are saved and going to heaven when we die. <br />  Consider four things we can know
						for sure. <br />
                        We can know for sure about Sin <br />  Romans 3:23 <br /> says: “All have sinned and come short of
						the glory of God“ Isaiah 53:6 says: “All we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone
						unto his own way“ <br /> We are sinners by birth and by choice. <br /> It is our nature to sin against God.
						No matter what your color, class, or creed is, you have sinned against God. <br /> (Romans 3:10) <br /> We
						can know for sure about the Sovereign <br /> The Bible teaches there is a sovereign God. <br /> He is
						forever holy and He cannot look upon sin.<br />  Because He is holy, He must judge sin. <br /> Romans
						6:23 <br /> says: “For the wages of sin is death“ Death means eternal separation from the Holy God IN
						HELL. <br />  We can know for sure about the Savior <br />  God sent His Son, the Lord Jesus, to pay for our
						sins on the cross. <br /> Jesus was God in Flesh <br /> (I Timothy 3:16). <br />  He lived a perfect life and died
						in our place. <br />  The Lord Jesus satisfied God’s holiness on the cross. <br />  The Lord Jesus rose again
						from the dead on the third day. <br />  (I Corinthians 15:1-3) There is no other way to be saved
						except <br /> through Jesus Christ our Lord. Acts 4:12 We can know for sure about Salvation Salvation
						is the <br /> FREE GIFT <br /> of God for all who will receive it. Ephesians 2:8-9 <br /> says: “For by grace are ye
						saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any
						man should boast.“ If you, by faith, will receive the Lord Jesus, <br /> HE WILL FORGIVE YOU <br /> of all
						your sins and He will <br /> SAVE YOUR SOUL TODAY. Just say this prayer and mean it from your heart:
						Dear Lord Jesus, I know that I am a sinner, I know that I am lost, I want to be saved, Come into
						my heart, Save my soul, Help me to live for you, In Jesus name, Amen. On the authority of God,
						the Word of God says He will save you. Romans 10:13 says:  <br />“For whosoever shall call upon the
						name of the Lord shall be saved“ Make a change in your life and have eternal life with Christ! <br />
						May God Richly Bless You
